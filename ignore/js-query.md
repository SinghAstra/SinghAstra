1. Difference b/w undefined and null ?
   Undefined: Represents Implicit Absence. It is the default value assigned by the JS Engine when memory is allocated but not initialized.
   Null: Represents Explicit Absence. It is a value assigned Programmatically by the developer to signal "this variable is intentionally empty" (e.g. let x = null;).
