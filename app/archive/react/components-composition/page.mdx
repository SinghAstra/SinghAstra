## 1. What is a Component?

Component is a reusable JavaScript Function that accepts Props and returns React JSX elements describing what should appear on the screen.

## 2. Functional Components

They are just standard JavaScript functions describing UI.

```javascript
// 1. Define the component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// OR using Arrow Functions (Preferred by many)
const Welcome = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};

// 2. Use it
// <Welcome name="Sara" />
```

### Key Characteristics:

- No `this` keyword: You don't need to worry about binding contexts.
- Less Boilerplate: No classes, no `render()` method.
- Hooks Support: They use `useState` and `useEffect` to handle data.

## 3. Class Components

Before 2019, whenever we needed state, we had to use a Class Component.

### Syntax

They inherit from `React.Component` and must have a `render()` method.

```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // You access props via 'this.props'
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Key Characteristics:

- Verbosity: Requires extending a class and a render method.
- `this` Confusion: You often have to bind methods manually (e.g., `this.handleClick.bind(this)`).
- Lifecycle Methods: Uses `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`.

## 4. Functional vs. Class Components: The Breakdown

| Feature          | Functional Components           | Class Components                        |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- |
| Syntax           | Plain JS Function               | ES6 Class                               |
| State Management | `useState` Hook                 | `this.state`                            |
| Side Effects     | `useEffect` Hook                | Lifecycle Methods (`componentDidMount`) |
| Boilerplate      | Low (Minimal code)              | High (Classes, `render`, `this`)        |
| Performance      | Slightly faster (less overhead) | Slightly heavier                        |
| Best Practice    | Yes (Default for new apps)      | No (Legacy/Maintenance only)            |

## 5. Component Composition

In React, we don't use inheritance (like `class AdminUser extends User`). We use Composition.

Composition means building complex components from simpler ones.

### The `children` Prop

This is a special prop that allows us to pass elements inside our component's opening and closing tags.

The Container (Wrapper):

```javascript
const Card = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="card-box">
      {/* This renders whatever is put inside <Card>...</Card> */}
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Usage:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      {/* All of this is passed as 'props.children' to Card */}
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <p>Name: John Doe</p>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

This pattern is critical for creating reusable layouts (like Modals, Cards, or Layout Wrappers) where the container doesn't care what is inside it.

| Concept              | Definition                        | Key Takeaway                                 |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Component            | A reusable piece of UI.           | Splits UI into independent, isolated pieces. |
| Functional Component | A function returning JSX.         | The modern standard. Uses Hooks.             |
| Class Component      | A class with a `render()` method. | Legacy. Uses `this` and lifecycle methods.   |
| Composition          | Nesting components inside others. | Powerful pattern to reuse UI logic/layout.   |
| `props.children`     | Special prop for nested content.  | Allows components to act as wrappers.        |

## 🛑 Stop and Think

### _1. In a Class component, if you try to access `props.name` without `this`, what will happen?_

We will get a ReferenceError: props is not defined.

- Why: In a Class, `props` is not a variable passed into the `render()` function as an argument. It is a property stored on the instance of the class itself.
- Therefore, we must strictly access it via `this.props`.
- Note: This is one of the main reasons people disliked classes forgetting `this` caused constant bugs. Functional components fix this because `props` is just a standard function argument.

### _2. Can a component return `undefined` or `null`? If so, what does React render?_

Answer:

- `null`: Yes! This is the standard way to tell React to render nothing (hide the component). It is valid and common.
- `undefined`: In older React versions, returning `undefined` was considered an error (often meaning dev forgot the `return` statement). In modern React, it acts like `null` (renders nothing), but relies on implicit behavior. It is best practice to explicitly return `null` if we want to render nothing.
