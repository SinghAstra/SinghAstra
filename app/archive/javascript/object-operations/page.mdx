## Object Operations 🔧

### 4.0 Access & Manipulation

There are two distinct syntaxes, and they are not just stylistic choices—they behave differently at the architectural level.

#### A. Dot Notation (The Static Interface)

- Restriction: The key must be a valid Identifier (no spaces, can't start with a number, no special characters).
- Limitation: It is Static. You cannot use a variable. The engine interprets the text after the dot literally.

#### B. Bracket Notation (The Dynamic Interface)

- Capability: It evaluates the expression inside the brackets before accessing the property.
- Use Case: Accessing properties dynamically (e.g., from user input) or properties with "illegal" names (e.g., "Content-Type").
- Computed Property Names (ES6): The ability to use brackets directly inside an object literal definition.

Example:

```javascript
let key = "status";
let data = {
  [key]: "Active", // Creates { status: "Active" }
  ["user_" + 101]: 123, // Creates { user_101: 123 }
};
```

### 4.1 The Key Mechanism (Implicit Conversion)

This is the most fundamental architectural constraint of standard JavaScript Objects.

#### A. The String Rule

In a standard Object, all keys are Strings (or Symbols). If you try to use any other data type as a key, the engine will silently convert it to a string before storage.

#### B. Implicit Coercion (The Trap)

Consider this scenario where we try to use Objects as keys:

```javascript
let user = { id: 1 };
let admin = { id: 2 };

let dictionary = {};
dictionary[user] = "User Data";
dictionary[admin] = "Admin Data";

console.log(dictionary[user]); // Output: "Admin Data"
```

- The Mechanism:

  1.  The engine receives an Object (user) as a key.
  2.  It calls .toString() on the object.
  3.  The result is the generic string "[object Object]".
  4.  It saves the value under that string key.
  5.  It repeats the process for admin, which generates the exact same key "[object Object]", overwriting the first entry.

- The Architectural Flaw: Standard Objects are not true Hash Maps because they cannot handle unique object references as keys. (This is why the Map data structure exists, which we cover in Unit 5).

### 4.2 Iteration Strategies

Iterating over an Object is computationally more complex than iterating over an Array because Objects are unordered graphs, not linear lists.

#### A. The Prototype Problem (for...in)

The for...in loop is the legacy way to iterate keys.

- Mechanism: It walks the chain. It iterates over all Enumerable properties on the object AND its Prototype Chain.
- Risk: If a third-party library adds a method to Object.prototype, your loop will iterate over that method, potentially breaking your logic.
- Defense: You historically had to use obj.hasOwnProperty(key) inside every loop.

#### B. The Static Method Solution (Object.keys / .values / .entries)

Modern JavaScript introduces static methods that fix the for...in issues.

- Mechanism: These methods return an Array containing only the object's Own (non-inherited) properties.
- Architecture Benefit: By converting the Object's data into an Array (Unit 3.1), you gain access to the powerful Array methods (Map, Filter, Reduce) defined in Unit 6.

Example:

```javascript
const data = { a: 1, b: 2 };

// Safe iteration (no prototype pollution)
Object.keys(data).forEach((key) => {
  console.log(key, data[key]);
});
```
