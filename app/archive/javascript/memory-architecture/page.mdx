## Memory Architecture

### The Physical Reality (RAM)

Before code runs, it must have a physical place to live.

- Hardware: RAM (Random Access Memory).
  - Physically, it is a massive, linear grid of addressable Bytes (8-bit storage cells).
- The Abstraction (The Slot):
  - The JavaScript Engine (V8) doesn't manage single bytes; it groups them into larger, usable chunks called Memory Slots (typically 64-bits or 8 bytes on modern machines).
  - Rule: Every variable you declare gets assigned to one of these Slots.
- The Process: When a JavaScript program runs, the Operating System allocates a specific slice of RAM to it. The Engine divides this slice into two primary regions: The Stack and The Heap.

### The Stack Memory (Static & Structured)

#### A. Definition

The Stack is a region of memory reserved for Static Allocation.

- "Static" means the engine knows the size of the data at compile time (before execution).
- Data Types: Stores Primitives (number, boolean, undefined, null) and References (Memory Addresses pointing to the Heap).

#### B. Structure: LIFO

It follows the Last In, First Out data structure.

- Contiguous: The data blocks sit physically next to each other in RAM.

#### C. The Hardware Mechanism: The Stack Pointer (SP)

The Stack is managed by a CPU register (absolute fastest and smallest memory storage units in computer) called the Stack Pointer.

- Definition: The SP is a pointer that tracks the exact memory address of the Top of the Stack.
- The Boundary: Everything below the SP is "Live Data." Everything above it is "Empty/Garbage."
- Allocation (Push): When a function is called, the CPU moves the SP UP (to reserved space) and writes the data.
- De-allocation (Pop): When a function returns, the CPU simply moves the SP DOWN.
- Crucial Note: The data is not erased. It is just abandoned. The computer considers that space free to be overwritten by the next function.

#### D. Characteristics

- Speed: Extremely Fast. Allocation is just one CPU instruction (moving the SP). Access is cache-friendly (contiguous).
- Limit: Fixed Size. The OS limits the Stack size.
- Failure State: Stack Overflow. If the SP moves past the limit, the program crashes.

### The Heap Memory (Dynamic & Unstructured)

#### A. Definition

The Heap is a massive pool of memory reserved for Dynamic Allocation. It starts small and grows dynamically as our application needs more memory. When we create new objects, the engine asks the Operating System for more space.

- Dynamic means the size of the data can change at runtime (e.g., an Array growing from 1 item to 1000 items).
- Data Types: Stores Objects, Arrays, and Functions.

#### B. Structure

- There is no order (unlike the Stack).
- Fragmented: Data is scattered wherever the engine can find a free gap large enough to fit the object.

#### C. Memory Management: Garbage Collection (GC)

Because the Heap has no Stack Pointer to automatically clean up data, it requires a "Janitor."

- The Problem: If you create an object and stop using it, it stays in RAM, clogging up memory (Memory Leak).
- The Solution: The Garbage Collector (GC).
- Mechanism (Mark and Sweep):
  1.  Roots: The GC starts at the Roots (Global Variables + Active Stack Frames).
  2.  Traverse: It follows all pointers (references) to the Heap.
  3.  Mark: It marks every reachable object as "Alive."
  4.  Sweep: Any object in the Heap not marked is deleted, and the memory is reclaimed.
- Frequency & Triggers (Non-Deterministic): The GC does not run continuously (it would freeze the main thread). It is periodic.
  1. Trigger 1 (Memory Pressure): It runs when the Heap is getting full and the engine needs space for a new allocation.
  2. Trigger 2 (Idle Time): Modern engines try to run small cleanups when the CPU is idle (user is not interacting).

#### D. Characteristics

- Speed: Slower.
- Allocation: The engine must search for a free gap.
- Access: Requires Pointer Traversal (jumping from Stack Address to Heap Address).
- Limit: Limited only by the Process Memory limit (can be Gigabytes).
