# Rendering Strategies & Timings

## The Build Time vs. Request Time Pivot

Next.js categorizes every route segment into either Static or Dynamic rendering. This categorization determines when the HTML and the RSC Payload are generated and how they are cached.

### Static Rendering

In Static Rendering, the rendering work happens once at Build Time or in the background.

- Output: The server generates the HTML and the RSC Payload and stores them in the Data Cache.
- Deployment: These files are moved to the Edge/CDN. When a request is made, the result is served instantly without server-side computation.
- Requirement: To remain static, a route must not use "Dynamic Functions" and must use cached data.

### Dynamic Rendering

If a route requires information only available at the moment of the request, Next.js switches to Dynamic Rendering.

- Execution: The server-side code (Server Components) runs for every single request.
- Output: The HTML and RSC Payload are generated on-the-fly.
- Dynamic Triggers (Opt-out of Static):

1. Dynamic Functions: Accessing `cookies()`, `headers()`, or the `searchParams` prop in a Page.
2. Uncached Data Fetching: Using `fetch` with `cache: 'no-store'` or `next: { revalidate: 0 }`.
3. Database Queries: Directly calling a DB client (Prisma/Drizzle) without a wrapping `cache()` or `revalidate` signal.

### 2.1.3 The Params vs. SearchParams Distinction

The framework treats URL data differently based on its predictability:

- Route Params (`params`): Used in dynamic segments like `[id]`. These are Staticable. Next.js assumes a finite set of IDs can be pre-rendered.
- Query Strings (`searchParams`): Used after the `?` in a URL. These are Inherently Dynamic. Since query strings are arbitrary and infinite, any component accessing them forces the route into Dynamic Rendering at request-time.

### 2.1.4 Staticizing Dynamic Segments (`generateStaticParams`)

To achieve Static Rendering performance on a dynamic path (e.g., `/blog/[slug]`), we use `generateStaticParams`.

- Mechanism: This function runs at Build Time to retrieve a list of potential values for the segment.
- Result: Next.js generates individual static HTML/RSC Payload files for every object returned by the function.
- Fallback Behavior: If a user visits a slug not generated at build time, Next.js can be configured to render it on-demand and then cache it statically for future users.

```tsx
// Example: Building static paths for top 100 products
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const products = await getTopProducts(); // Fetched at build
  return products.map((product) => ({
    id: product.id.toString(),
  }));
}
```

## 📝 The Rendering Matrix (Technical Version)

| Axis         | Static (Build-Time)             | Dynamic (Request-Time)                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Data Source  | Cached/Build-time fetch.        | `cookies()`, `headers()`, `no-store`.    |
| Cache Store  | CDN / Edge Cache.               | No persistent CDN cache for the Payload. |
| Compute Cost | One-time (at build).            | Per-request (Server execution).          |
| TTFB         | Minimal (Network latency only). | Variable (Server-side render time).      |

## 🛑 Stop and Think

> The Deterministic Rule: Next.js will always attempt to make a route Static unless it encounters a "Dynamic Signal." As an architect, your goal is to minimize these signals. If a page needs user-specific data, fetch it in a Client Component or via Streaming to keep the surrounding Server Component shell Static.
