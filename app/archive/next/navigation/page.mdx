# Navigation & Linking

In a standard multipage application, clicking a link triggers a full browser refresh the screen goes white, the script reloads, and state is lost. Next.js uses a Client Side Router that intercepts these clicks, making transitions feel like a mobile app while maintaining the benefits of a multi page structure.

## The Link Component

The `<Link>` component is the primary way to navigate in Next.js. It is an extension of the HTML `<a>` tag that provides Prefetching and Client-Side Navigation.

### 1. Prefetching (The Secret to Speed)

Prefetching is how Next.js makes pages feel like they load instantly. When a `<Link>` component enters the user's viewport (the visible part of the screen), Next.js automatically begins downloading the code and data for that route in the background.

- Static Routes: The entire route is prefetched and cached.
- Dynamic Routes: Only the shared layout and the loading state are prefetched.
- The Benefit: By the time the user actually clicks the link, the necessary data is already in the browser's memory.

### 2. Client Side Transitions

When we click a `<Link>`, Next.js does not refresh the page. Instead:

1. It updates the URL in the browser's address bar.
2. It swaps out the Page component while keeping the Layout alive (State Preservation).
3. It only downloads the the specific code/data that is different from the current page.

### 3. Usage & Best Practices

We should always use `<Link>` for internal navigation. Use standard `<a>` tags only for external links.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Prefetching happens automatically when this enters view */}
      <Link href="/dashboard" prefetch={true}>
        Dashboard
      </Link>

      {/* We can disable prefetching for low-priority pages */}
      <Link href="/settings" prefetch={false}>
        Settings
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

## 📝 Navigation Mechanics Table

| Feature            | Standard `<a>` Tag         | Next.js `<Link>` Component      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Browser Refresh    | Full Refresh (White Flash) | No Refresh (Instant Swap)       |
| State Preservation | Lost (App restarts)        | Maintained (Layouts stay alive) |
| Data Fetching      | On Click                   | On Viewport (via Prefetching)   |
| Bundle Impact      | Downloads entire page      | Downloads only the segment diff |

## 🛑 Stop and Think

> Prefetching is the reason why Next.js apps feel 'faster' than regular React apps. However, be careful with huge lists of links; prefetching too many routes at once can consume unnecessary data for mobile users. If a route isn't vital, use `prefetch={false}`.

## Programmatic Navigation

Next.js provides two distinct ways to navigate via code: one for the Client and one for the Server.

### 1. Client-Side: `useRouter()`

When we are inside a Client Component (`'use client'`), we use the `useRouter` hook.

- Role: Interactive navigation (e.g., clicking a custom button or search bar logic).
- Methods: `.push()` (adds to history), `.replace()` (replaces current history), `.refresh()` (refreshes data without losing state).

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export function SearchButton() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleSearch = () => {
    // Logic here...
    router.push("/results");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>;
}
```

### 2. Server-Side: `redirect()`

When we are in a Server Component or a Server Action, we cannot use hooks. Instead, we use the `redirect()` function.

- Role: Logical redirection (e.g., unauthorized users or successful form submissions).
- Mechanism: It throws a special internal error that Next.js catches to handle the transition.

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

async function fetchUser(id: string) {
  const user = await db.user.find(id);
  if (!user) {
    redirect("/404"); // Triggers immediately on the server
  }
}
```

## The Router Cache

Next.js has an invisible friend called the Router Cache (sometimes called the Client-side Cache). It is a temporary memory store that lives in the browser while the user is using our app.

### 1. How it works

When a user navigates to a new route, Next.js stores the Server Component Payload (the rendered UI) in this cache.

- The Result: If the user clicks the Back button, Next.js doesn't go back to the server. It pulls the page directly from the browser's memory. This is why Back and Forward feel instant.
- Static Routes: Cached for 5 minutes.
- Dynamic Routes: Cached for 30 seconds.

### 2. How to clear the cache

Sometimes we want the cache to be destroyed (e.g., after a user deletes an item, the Back button shouldn't show that item anymore).

- `router.refresh()`: Clears the cache for the current route and fetches fresh data from the server.
- Server Actions: Using `revalidatePath()` or `revalidateTag()` automatically purges the router cache to ensure the UI stays in sync with the database.

| Tool                | Environment   | Best Use Case                               |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `<Link>`            | Client/Server | Standard UI navigation (SEO friendly).      |
| `useRouter`         | Client Only   | Button clicks, search bar logic.            |
| `redirect`          | Server Only   | Auth checks, form submission success.       |
| `permanentRedirect` | Server Only   | Changing a URL structure permanently (301). |

## 🛑 Stop and Think

> A common mistake is trying to use `useRouter` in a Server Component. Remember: Hooks are for the browser. If we are doing logic on the server (like checking a session), use `redirect`. If we are handling a user's click, use `useRouter` or `<Link>`.
