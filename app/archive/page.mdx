# The SinghAstra Archives

Welcome to the documentation of my journey. The purpose of these notes is to establish a definitive baseline. I am writing this to assure myself that the "Fundamentals" are no longer abstract concepts,
but concrete tools in my arsenal.

## The Methodology: Iterative Deepening

I approach these notes using the Iterative Deepening Methodology (IDM). Knowledge is not acquired linearly; it is acquired in layers.

## The Scope

For this specific archive, I am focusing on the Modern Web Triad. In Future I am planning to add Applied AI into my arsenal.

- JavaScript (The Core)
- React (The Library)
- Next.js (The Framework)

Let the deepening begin.
