                Curiosity as a Driving Force
              </h3>
              <p>
                I am driven by a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to
                create things that have a meaningful impact. For me, engineering
                is the ideal path to pursue this passion, as it empowers me to
                turn ideas into reality.

                Focusing on Web Development
              </h3>
              <p>
                Through this journey, I recognized that mastering web
                development provides a strong foundation applicable to many
                other areas of tech. As a result, I am currently specializing as
                a web developer, confident that these skills will help me branch
                out into other areas of development and engineering in the
                future.
